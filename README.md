# DragnDrop
This repository is about the implementation of simple *DragnDrop* in _VueJS_. Cards can be dragged from Sidebar and dropped to the dropzones.
Some **Extra** features are also added. For eg. :-
```
1. Adding a Card at the top/bottom of the Sidebar.

2. Deleting a Card from the Sidebar/DropZones.

```

**Whenever any Card is reordered in the DropZones, its ID gets updated as per its position.**
